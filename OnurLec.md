## üìö Lecture 1: Introduction & Transistors

### üß† Course Goals
- Understand how computers work from the ground up.
- Learn digital design and computer architecture principles.
- Design and debug a simple microprocessor.
- Think critically and systematically about computing systems.

### üí° What is a Computer?
- Comprised of computation, communication, and storage/memory.
- Translates from Problem ‚Üí Algorithm ‚Üí Program ‚Üí System Software ‚Üí Hardware.

### üß± Transformation Hierarchy
- Electrons ‚Üí Devices ‚Üí Logic ‚Üí Architecture ‚Üí Language ‚Üí Problem.
- Co-design across layers is essential.

### üíª General-Purpose vs. Special-Purpose Systems
- **CPUs**: Flexible and programmable.
- **GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs**: High performance, less flexibility.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Transistors and CMOS Logic
- **MOSFETs**: NMOS conducts when Gate=High; PMOS conducts when Gate=Low.
- **CMOS Inverter**: PMOS + NMOS = NOT gate.

### üìà Moore‚Äôs Law
- Transistor count doubles ~every 2 years ‚Üí better performance and cost efficiency.

## üîß Lecture 2: Logic Gates and Boolean Algebra

### üîå Logic Basics
- Combinational logic: output = f(inputs).
- Gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR.
- Avoid floating inputs; use tri-state buffers for buses.

### üßÆ Boolean Algebra
- Tools: DeMorgan‚Äôs Laws, Duality, Truth Tables.
- Canonical forms: SOP (Œ£m), POS (Œ†M).
- Laws: Commutative, Associative, Distributive.

### üß± Building Blocks
- **Decoder**: n inputs ‚Üí 2^n outputs.
- **Multiplexer**: 2^n inputs ‚Üí 1 output.
- **Adders**: Half, Full, Ripple-Carry.
- **PLAs**: Flexible SOP logic.
- Minimization: Boolean Algebra, Karnaugh Maps, Quine-McCluskey.

## üîÅ Lecture 3: Sequential Logic

### üîÑ Combinational vs. Sequential
- **Sequential**: Output depends on inputs AND previous state.
- Requires storage: Latches, Flip-Flops.

### üß† Memory Elements
- SR Latch, D Latch, D Flip-Flop (edge-triggered).
- Registers = Group of Flip-Flops.
- Memory = Addressable array of registers.

### üö¶ Finite State Machines (FSMs)
- Components: States, Inputs/Outputs, Transition Logic.
- **Moore FSM**: output depends on state.
- **Mealy FSM**: output depends on state + input.

## üö¶ Lecture 4: FSM Design & FPGA Introduction

### ‚úÖ FSM Design Process
1. Identify states.
2. Define transitions and outputs.
3. Choose encoding: binary, one-hot, output-encoded.
4. Draw state diagram/table.
5. Implement using Flip-Flops and logic.

### üïí Timing Concepts
- Setup Time, Hold Time.
- Clock Period must accommodate logic delay.
- Clock Skew affects timing margins.

### üîå FPGA Overview
- LUT-based logic, configurable routing.
- Use cases: AI, bioinformatics, cryptography.

## üíª Lecture 5: Verilog & Hardware Description Languages

### üõ†Ô∏è HDL Motivation
- Supports structural & behavioral modeling.
- Simulation and synthesis for digital circuits.

### üß± Verilog Essentials
- Modules, `assign`, `always` blocks.
- Operators: `&`, `|`, `~`, `^`, `? :`, `case`.

### üì¶ Behavioral vs Structural
- **Behavioral**: Describes what circuit does.
- **Structural**: Describes how it‚Äôs built.

### üß¨ FSM in Verilog
- 3-part model: State Register, Next-State Logic, Output Logic.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Lecture 6: Timing & Verification

### üß≠ Circuit Timing

#### Combinational
- **Propagation delay (tpd)**: Max output delay.
- **Contamination delay (tcd)**: Min output delay.
- Glitches: Due to unequal delays.

#### Sequential
- **Setup Time**: Data stable before clock.
- **Hold Time**: Data stable after clock.
- **Clock-to-Q delay**: Time from clock to output change.

- Timing equations:
  - Setup: `Tc > tpcq + tpd + tsetup`
  - Hold: `tccq + tcd > thold`

- Clock Skew impacts timing margins.

### üß™ Verification Types
- **Functional**: Logic correctness.
- **Timing**: Meet setup/hold constraints.
- **Simulation**: Testbenches (manual, self-checking, golden models).
- **Formal Verification**: SAT solvers, model checking.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Optimization
- Vivado, SPICE, Logic Synthesis, Place-and-Route.
- Use pipelining, critical path reduction.
- Consider process variation and worst-case delays.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices & Pitfalls

### ‚úÖ Do:
- Plan for timing from the beginning.
- Write synthesizable Verilog.
- Use self-checking testbenches.
- Balance logic across flip-flop paths.
- Document everything clearly.

### ‚ùå Avoid:
- Ignoring hold time or skew.
- Mixed blocking/non-blocking assignments.
- Incomplete `case` or `if` statements.
- Over-reliance on simulation without timing checks.
